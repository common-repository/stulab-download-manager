== Description ==
**A FULL FREE** Simple file publishing plugin allowing any type of file to be downloaded and published securely.

Each file is managed as a custom blog and is attached to an automatic standard blog containing file sheet.
By standard blog usage, is it possible to manage file and its sheet with other plugins such as membership managers.

Security is ensured by compression and encryption process on each file uploaded to the local server. File name is also hidden. So, uploaded files just can't be played directly.
Shortcodes allow you to customize your posts as you like. For security reasons, file name is never displayed even in download links.
